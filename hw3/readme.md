#Visualization in HCI Homework 3
*Due: Wednesday, February 15, 12:00pm (noon).*

David Lu (dlu1)

Extra Features:
* Smooth animations for bar chart interactions
* World Map outlines and pops out countries when hovered over.
* Hover-tooltips for both bar chart and world map

Would liked to have made the world map more interactable (such as clicking to return country results), however ran out of time.  Perhaps at a future date.
