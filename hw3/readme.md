Extra Features:
* Smooth animations for bar chart interactions
* World Map outlines and pops out countries when hovered over.
* Hover-tooltips for both bar chart and world map

Would liked to have made the world map more interactable (such as clicking to return country results), however ran out of time.  Perhaps at a future date.

In addition, having the map highlight where a country is when you hover over the participating teams list would be really cool and personally I think would be very useful.  It would be associating the names with the country codes (not too difficult given our data provided both sets of information), and then calling the appropriate country to "light up."
